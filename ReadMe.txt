This repository contains the MATLAB codes used in the paper:
B. K. Poolla, S. Bolognani, and F. DÃ¶rfler, "Optimal Placement of Virtual Inertia in Power Grids", IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control.

optimalplacement.m contains the raw network data: inertia, damping, network laplacian, and the optimization routine for solving the placement problem.

grad.m contains the routine which solves the rank-deficient Lyapunov solution implicitly used for solving the placement problem.
